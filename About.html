    <h1 center style ="font-family: Yellowtail"> Causes Air Pollution?</h1>
<p>
    Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air.
    These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. 
    The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols. Air pollution happens when solid and liquid particles—called aerosols—and certain gases end up in our air. 
    These particles and gases can be bad for the planet and for our health, so keeping track of them is important.
    Certain gases in the atmosphere can cause air pollution. For example, in cities, a gas called ozone is a major cause of air pollution.
    Ozone is also a greenhouse gas that can be both good and bad for our environment. 
    It all depends where it is in Earth’s atmosphere.
