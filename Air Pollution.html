                    The thing about our atmosphere is that people have used a lot of car fuel with that it will form carbon dioxide.<br>
                    Typically, Carbon dioxide is really bad for us humans to breath in based on my research carbon dioxide can be bad in many forms like  CO2 can produce a variety of health effects.
                    These many bad conditions including headaches, dizziness, restlessness, a tingling or pins or needles feeling, difficulty breathing, sweating, tiredness, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, coma, asphyxia, and convulsions.
                    people with health issues have a hard time to breath can have even more problems because of that. 
                    Air pollution is form that
